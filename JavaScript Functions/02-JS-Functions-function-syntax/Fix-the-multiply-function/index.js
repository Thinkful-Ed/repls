// Here's the function. It's missing two pieces. Can you fix it?
function multiply(num1) {
   num1 * num2
}

// These are examples of using the function. You don't need to change them
multiply(2, 5); // should be 10
multiply(25, 10); // should be 250
multiply(5, 15); // should be 75

// This tests your code - you can ignore it for now!
