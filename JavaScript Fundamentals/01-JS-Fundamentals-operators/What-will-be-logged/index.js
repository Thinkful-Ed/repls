// For each of the examples, what will be logged?
// Enter your guesses before you hit run!

// One
// Does addition work?
let x = 21 + 3;
// enter your guess where the '0' is on the next line
let guessOne = 0;
console.log(x);

// Two
// What will happen when there is more than one operator?
let y = 2 * 2 + 1;
// Enter your guess on the next line, where the '0' is
let guessTwo = 0;
console.log(y);

// Three
// What does it mean to add words together?
let z = "We use repls for " + "drills, playgrounds, and prediction.";
// Enter your guess inside the "" below
// Be careful! The text has to match exactly.
let guessThree = "";
console.log(z);
