<p>Seljalandsfoss is one of the best known waterfalls in Iceland. Seljalandsfoss is located in the South Region in Iceland right by Route 1 and the road that leads to Þórsmörk Road 249. The waterfall drops 60 m (197 ft). One of the interesting things about this waterfall is that visitors can walk behind it into a small cave.</p>
