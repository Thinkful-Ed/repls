(Paragraph:)
So, while they were walking through the forest, the Tin Woodman told the following story:
 
(Paragraph:)
"I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest and sold the wood for a living. When I grew up, I too became a wood chopper, and after my father died I took care of my old mother as long as she lived. Then I made up my mind that instead of living alone I would marry, so that I might not become lonely.
